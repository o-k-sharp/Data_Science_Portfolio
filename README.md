# Successful Game Features Problem

## Executive Summary

The project used Kaggle data to identify factors influencing Steam game success, applying a Random Forest algorithm after thorough data preprocessing. 
Initial results showed high accuracy but revealed issues with low recall and F1 scores, indicating that the model struggled to identify successful 
games effectively.

Hyperparameter tuning improved model performance, resulting in a final model with significantly enhanced recall and F1 scores. The final model 
demonstrated superior performance in predicting game success, with increased capability to correctly identify successful games compared to the 
initial model. The Random Forest model identified key predictors of video game success, such as genre and user ratings, which can directly inform 
game development and marketing strategies. These insights suggest that developers should prioritise optimising user experience in specific genres to 
maximise game success
